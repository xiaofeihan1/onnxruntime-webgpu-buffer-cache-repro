# ONNX Runtime WebGPU Buffer Cache Repro

The ONNX Runtime WebGPU EP supports several storage-buffer cache modes in its
C++ core, but `onnxruntime-web` does not forward the option from JS, so web
apps are pinned to the default `bucket` mode. For static-shape models the
bucket rounding is expensive. This page makes the cost visible.

## What the page does

It runs the same static-shape model twice per mode and compares:

- `Official bucket` — `onnxruntime-web@1.26.0` as published (default cache
  mode).
- `Patched simple` — the same `ort.webgpu.min.mjs` with one line added to
  forward `storageBufferCacheMode`, then `storageBufferCacheMode: 'simple'`.
- `Patched disabled` — the same patched bundle with
  `storageBufferCacheMode: 'disabled'`, which disables storage-buffer reuse.

The only difference between the patched modes is the value of the forwarded
option.

Model: [Musetric RoFormer vocal separation](https://huggingface.co/musetric/vocal-separation-roformer-onnx)
(fp16 weights, fp32 I/O `stft_repr` / `masks: [1, 2050, 1101, 2]`, 741 MB).
It is downloaded from Hugging Face when a run starts and is not stored in this
repository. The input is a deterministic random tensor.

## What it measures

The page wraps `GPUDevice.createBuffer`, `GPUBuffer.destroy` and
`GPUQueue.submit`, then reports per mode:

- **Weights** — bytes still resident after session create (identical in both
  modes).
- **Peak live** — maximum bytes alive at any moment.
- **Run 1 / Run 2 allocations** — new buffer bytes created during each run.
  The model is static, so an ideal cache allocates nothing on run 2.
- **Latency** per run and **submit count**.

Per-mode tabs show the live-buffer histogram at the peak.
